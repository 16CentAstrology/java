## Intro
When you are at GitHub, every subdirectory of this repo 
is a separate sample project that you can use 
if you have a similar project.

But when you are viewing this
right now as web page in `jdevfullstack.github.io` domain,
you need to click `View on GitHub` to download the
source codes.

Thanks!

## About Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
The C language is excellent in system programming.
But Java is known for creating applications, particularly 
web apps.

But have you ever asked yourself what is OOP?

When a programmer is dealing with system programming,
it is not much needed but when he/she is creating
user applications, there is a great need for OOP.

In basic terms, think of this situation:
if ever virtually you can treat the things
that you are manipulating as real objects
virtually, that will simplify your work, isn't it?

Say, you can treat exactly a 3D box as
a 3D box. Your code will act upon as if
it's an object. That's the essence of
being an OOP language. If that box will be
expressed using the C language purely,
how would you do it? How would you manipulate
data in terms of that? Surely, that will
complicate things.

But again, OOP has its own uses, particularly
when you are creating user applications like
web apps.
